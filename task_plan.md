Based on the provided source code (`mcp.pdf`) and the MCP specifications (`mcp_specifications.txt`), here's a task plan outlining the changes needed to transform your existing codebase into a fully compliant MCP server:

**I. Core Protocol Implementation**

*   **JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance:** Verify that all messages strictly adhere to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.
    *   Ensure all requests include a unique ID and method name.
    *   Confirm all responses include the same ID as the corresponding request.
    *   Validate that notifications do not include an ID.
*   **Message Handling:**
    *   Implement a robust message parsing and routing mechanism to handle `requests`, `responses`, and `notifications`.
    *   Ensure that the server does not send requests before receiving the `initialized` notification, other than `pings` and `logging`.
*   **Transport Layer:**
    *   **stdio:** Ensure the server can read and write JSON-RPC messages over `stdin` and `stdout` respectively, delimited by newlines. The server should not write to stdout anything that is not a valid MCP message.
    *   **HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE):** Implement the SSE transport mechanism for message exchange.
    *   **Custom Transports:** Make sure the architecture supports custom transport implementations that preserve the JSON-RPC message format.

**II. Lifecycle Management**

*   **Initialization:** Implement the `initialize` method.
    *   Ensure the server responds with its capabilities and server information.
    *   Implement version negotiation to agree on a single protocol version.
    *   Handle the `initialized` notification from the client.
*   **Shutdown**: Implement a proper shutdown mechanism.

**III. Capability Negotiation**

*   **Capability Declaration:** The server must accurately declare its supported features (e.g., `resources`, `tools`, `prompts`, `logging`) during initialization.
*   **Capability Enforcement:** The server must respect the declared capabilities throughout the session.

**IV. Server Features**

*   **Prompts:**
    *   Implement the `prompts/list` method to list available prompts with pagination.
    *   Implement the `prompts/get` method to retrieve a specific prompt.
    *   Implement notifications using the `notifications/prompts/list_changed` method when the list of prompts changes.
*   **Resources:**
    *   Implement the `resources/list` method to list available resources with pagination.
    *    Implement the `resources/read` method to read a specific resource.
    *   Implement the `resources/subscribe` method and handle subscriptions.
    *   Implement the `notifications/resources/updated` notification when a subscribed resource is updated.
    *   Implement the `resources/templates/list` method to retrieve resource templates.
    *   Handle different URI schemes like `file://`, `https://`, and `git://`.
*   **Tools:**
    *   Implement the `tools/list` method to list available tools with pagination.
    *   Implement the `tools/call` method to execute a specific tool.
    *   Implement the `notifications/tools/list_changed` method when the list of tools changes.
    *  Implement input validation for tools based on their `inputSchema`.

**V. Client Features (If applicable to your server)**

*   **Roots:** If your server needs to work with the file system, implement the `roots/list` method, expose roots using file URIs and handle notifications on root list changes.
*  **Sampling:** if the server needs to perform LLM sampling, the server must use the client via `sampling/createMessage`.

**VI. Utilities**

*   **Logging:**
    *   Implement the `logging/setLevel` method to control the minimum log level.
    *   Implement the `notifications/message` method to send log messages.
    *   Follow syslog severity levels.
*   **Cancellation:** Implement cancellation of in-progress requests with the `notifications/cancelled` notification.
*    **Progress:** Implement progress updates with the `notifications/progress` notification.
*   **Ping:** Implement the ping mechanism using request/response.
*   **Completion:** Implement `completion/complete` method to provide argument autocompletion for prompts and resources.
*   **Pagination:** Implement cursor-based pagination in list operations.
    *   Ensure stable cursors and graceful handling of invalid cursors.

**VII. Security Considerations**

*   **Input Validation**: Sanitize all inputs, including prompt arguments, resource URIs, and tool parameters, to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Access Control**: Implement appropriate access control mechanisms to protect sensitive resources and tools.
*   **Data Protection**: Ensure sensitive data is handled securely, including proper encoding of binary data.
*   **User Consent:** Implementations MUST provide a mechanism for users to authorize data access and operations.
*   **Sampling Approval**: Make sure users explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests.
*   **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the system.

**VIII. Authentication and Authorization**

*   **Custom Strategies:** Since auth is not part of the core MCP spec, implement a custom authentication and authorization strategy if necessary.
*   **OAuth 2.1**:  If using HTTP+SSE transport, you may consider the optional authorization using OAuth 2.1, dynamic client registration and server metadata discovery. You also need to consider the token requirements and handling.

**IX. Codebase Refactoring/Fix Plan**

*   **Modular Design:** Refactor the codebase to separate concerns for better maintainability. Create modules for transport, message handling, resource management, tool execution, prompt handling etc.
*   **Error Handling:** Standardize error responses using the JSON-RPC error format.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure proper handling of asynchronous operations using channels or other concurrency primitives.
*   **Configuration:** Centralize the configuration of server parameters and capabilities.
*   **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests to ensure the correct implementation of MCP functionality.
*   **Documentation:** Create thorough documentation for the codebase and its MCP implementation.

By systematically addressing these points, you can transform your existing codebase into a fully compliant and robust MCP server, as specified in the official specification. This will enable seamless integration of your server with other MCP-compliant applications.
